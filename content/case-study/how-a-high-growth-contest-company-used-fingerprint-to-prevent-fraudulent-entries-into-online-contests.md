## The Problem 

A big issue when running contests, whether online or in person, is individuals attempting to game the system by entering multiple times to increase their chances of winning. As a result, the company needs to ensure its contestants know they are signing up for contests with a real chance of winning. 

## Why Fingerprint 

The company discovered Fingerprint after browsing the NPM (Node Package Manager) registry and decided to try the open-source version. Almost immediately, they transitioned to the paid version, Fingerprint Pro, given its higher device identification accuracy of 99.5%. 

> “We recommend Fingerprint to businesses that need to uniquely identify their users, especially where other ID methods are unacceptably cumbersome.”

### **Quick POC (Proof-of-concept) and implementation** 

The company was able to quickly test the accuracy of Fingerprint after implementation. They ran a proof of concept test by challenging employees to attempt to enter a contest multiple times, which they could not. After this small-scale test, the company felt comfortable implementing Fingerprint in their product and continued testing with real users. 

### **Room for growth** 

As fraud prevention tactics grow more commonplace, fraudsters will iterate and introduce new methods of fraudulent activity. The company quickly understood the limitations of using browser fingerprinting alone as a method of identification and plans to take advantage of Fingerprint Pro’s advanced signals to understand their fraudulent traffic better. 

### Ease of Use

The company needed an easy tool to set up as a high-growth startup. Given the ease of use and implementation, only one engineer is responsible for the entirety of Fingerprint’s usage at the company.
