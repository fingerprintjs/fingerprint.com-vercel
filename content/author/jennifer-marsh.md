bio: "Here is some text for my bio: I'm a software developer with a strong
  interest in cybersecurity. As an amateur hacker, I appreciate the many ways
  hackers find exploits in vulnerable code and love to read and write about the
  latest hacks. I aspire to get my first bounty, but I love educating users and
  developers on the ways they can protect their data."
