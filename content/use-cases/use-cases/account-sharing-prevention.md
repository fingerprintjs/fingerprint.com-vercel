## You have an account sharing problem, you just don’t know how big it is.

## **What is Account Sharing?**

[](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Credential_stuffing)Account Sharing describes the behavior of a user sharing their account login information so that subscription services can be spread out across multiple users. While Account Sharing can be cost-effective for users, it can destroy business models, significantly reduce the efficiency of economies of scale, enhance the risk of a 3rd party Account Takeover (ATO) and create messy questions of account ownership. A recent example shows [Netflix loses $6B per year](https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/netflix-loses-6b-a-year-revenue-due-to-password-sharing-analyst) due to Account Sharing.

## Why is **Account Sharing** Prevention Important?

* Lost Revenue
* Reduced Economies of Scale
* Inaccurate/Reduced User Metrics
* Increased Security Risk for Users
* Account Ownership Claims
